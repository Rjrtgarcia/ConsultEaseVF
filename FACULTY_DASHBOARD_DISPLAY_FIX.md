# Faculty Dashboard Display Fix

## Issue Description
Faculty cards were not showing in the student dashboard when the application was first loaded. The dashboard would appear empty even when faculty members existed in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was identified in the `DashboardWindow` class in `central_system/views/dashboard_window.py`. The dashboard window was being created and displayed, but there was **no initial call to load and populate the faculty grid** when the window was first shown.

### Previous Behavior:
- Faculty data was only loaded when:
  1. The refresh timer triggered (every 3 minutes)
  2. User performed a search/filter operation
  3. The `handle_faculty_updated` method was called from the main application
- No initial population occurred when the dashboard was first displayed

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `showEvent` Method
**File:** `central_system/views/dashboard_window.py`

Added a `showEvent` method to the `DashboardWindow` class that triggers initial faculty data loading when the window is first shown:

```python
def showEvent(self, event):
    """
    Handle window show event to trigger initial faculty data loading.
    """
    # Call parent showEvent first
    super().showEvent(event)
    
    # Load faculty data immediately when the window is first shown
    # Only do this if we haven't loaded faculty data yet
    if not hasattr(self, '_initial_load_done') or not self._initial_load_done:
        logger.info("Dashboard window shown - triggering initial faculty data load")
        self._initial_load_done = True
        
        # Schedule the initial faculty load after a short delay to ensure UI is ready
        QTimer.singleShot(100, self._perform_initial_faculty_load)
```

### 2. Added Initial Faculty Load Method
Added a dedicated method to perform the initial faculty data loading:

```python
def _perform_initial_faculty_load(self):
    """
    Perform the initial faculty data load when the dashboard is first shown.
    """
    try:
        logger.info("Performing initial faculty data load")
        
        # Import faculty controller
        from ..controllers import FacultyController
        
        # Get faculty controller
        faculty_controller = FacultyController()
        
        # Get all faculty members
        faculties = faculty_controller.get_all_faculty()
        
        logger.info(f"Initial load: Found {len(faculties)} faculty members")
        
        # Debug: Log each faculty member
        for faculty in faculties:
            logger.debug(f"Faculty found: {faculty.name} (ID: {faculty.id}, Status: {faculty.status}, Department: {faculty.department})")
        
        # Populate the faculty grid
        self.populate_faculty_grid(faculties)
        
        # Also update the consultation panel with faculty options
        if hasattr(self, 'consultation_panel'):
            self.consultation_panel.set_faculty_options(faculties)
            logger.debug("Updated consultation panel with faculty options")
        
        # Ensure scroll area starts at the top
        if hasattr(self, 'faculty_scroll') and self.faculty_scroll:
            self.faculty_scroll.verticalScrollBar().setValue(0)
            logger.debug("Reset scroll position to top")
            
        logger.info("Initial faculty data load completed successfully")
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error during initial faculty data load: {str(e)}")
        import traceback
        logger.error(f"Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
        # Show error message in the faculty grid
        self._show_error_message(f"Error loading faculty data: {str(e)}")
```

### 3. Fixed Pooled Faculty Card Visibility
**File:** `central_system/ui/pooled_faculty_card.py`

Fixed an issue where pooled faculty cards were hidden during reset but not shown again when reused:

```python
def configure(self, faculty_data: dict, consultation_callback: Optional[Callable] = None):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Ensure the card is visible when configured
    self.show()
    
    logger.debug(f"Configured faculty card for: {faculty_data.get('name', 'Unknown')}")
```

### 4. Cleaned Up Redundant Code
**File:** `central_system/views/dashboard_window.py`

Removed redundant empty faculty check in `populate_faculty_grid` method since the method already returns early if no faculties are found.

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Immediate Faculty Display**: Faculty cards now appear immediately when the dashboard is first shown
2. **Better User Experience**: No waiting for the 3-minute refresh timer to see faculty
3. **Proper Error Handling**: Clear error messages if faculty data loading fails
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Consultation Panel Integration**: Faculty options are also populated in the consultation panel

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Empty Database**: Verify proper empty state message is shown
2. **Test with Faculty Data**: Verify faculty cards appear immediately upon login
3. **Test Error Scenarios**: Verify proper error handling if database is unavailable
4. **Test Faculty Status**: Verify both available and unavailable faculty are displayed correctly
5. **Test Consultation Panel**: Verify faculty options are populated in the consultation form

## Files Modified

1. `central_system/views/dashboard_window.py`
   - Added `showEvent` method
   - Added `_perform_initial_faculty_load` method
   - Enhanced logging and error handling
   - Cleaned up redundant code

2. `central_system/ui/pooled_faculty_card.py`
   - Fixed card visibility issue in `configure` method

## Deployment Notes

- This fix is backward compatible and doesn't require database changes
- The fix will work immediately after deployment
- Enhanced logging will help with future troubleshooting
- No configuration changes required

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding a loading indicator during initial faculty load
2. Implement retry mechanism for failed initial loads
3. Add user feedback for empty faculty states
4. Consider caching faculty data for faster subsequent loads
