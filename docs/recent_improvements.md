# ConsultEase Recent Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the ConsultEase system to enhance functionality, fix bugs, and improve the user experience.

## On-Screen Keyboard Improvements

### What Changed
- **Squeekboard Prioritization**: The system now prioritizes the squeekboard keyboard over onboard for better integration with the Raspberry Pi environment
- **Improved Detection**: Better detection of available keyboard implementations
- **Enhanced Show/Hide Logic**: More reliable keyboard appearance and disappearance
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple fallback options when preferred keyboard is unavailable
- **Installation Script**: Comprehensive installation script for squeekboard

### Benefits
- More reliable text input on touchscreens
- Better compatibility with different Linux distributions
- Improved user experience with touch-friendly keyboard layout

### How to Use
Run the installation script to set up the improved keyboard:
```bash
cd /path/to/consultease
chmod +x scripts/install_squeekboard.sh
./scripts/install_squeekboard.sh
```

After installation, you'll have these keyboard management scripts:
- `~/keyboard-toggle.sh` - Toggle keyboard visibility
- `~/keyboard-show.sh` - Force show keyboard
- `~/keyboard-hide.sh` - Force hide keyboard

If you encounter any issues with the keyboard, you can run the fix script:
```bash
./scripts/fix_keyboard.sh
```

## MQTT Communication Improvements

### What Changed
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better handling of connection errors and message delivery failures

- **Message Storage**: Storage of recent messages for potential retry

### Benefits
- More reliable communication between system components
- Faster recovery from network interruptions
- Better handling of intermittent connectivity issues
- Improved system stability in challenging network environments

### How to Test
Test the improved MQTT communication:
```bash
# Subscribe to faculty status topic
mosquitto_sub -t "consultease/faculty/+/status"

# In another terminal, publish a test message
mosquitto_pub -t "consultease/faculty/1/status" -m "keychain_connected"

# Check the application logs for reconnection and keep-alive messages
tail -f logs/consultease.log
```
