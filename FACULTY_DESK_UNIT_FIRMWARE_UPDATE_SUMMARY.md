## üîß Technical Improvements

### Simplified Architecture
- **Single-purpose design**: Firmware now has one clear purpose - MAC address detection
- **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated dual-mode operation and associated complexity
- **Better resource utilization**: No longer running unnecessary BLE server alongside scanner
- **Cleaner code structure**: Removed conditional compilation and mode switching

### Enhanced MQTT Communication
- **Complete topic coverage**: All required topics properly configured and used
- **Proper MAC status reporting**: Detailed JSON payloads with MAC address information
- **Legacy compatibility**: Maintains support for existing central system versions
- **Improved error handling**: Better MQTT connection management

### Optimized BLE Implementation
- **Scanner-only mode**: Focused BLE implementation for better performance
- **Efficient scanning**: Optimized scanning parameters for reliable detection
- **Better MAC handling**: Improved MAC address normalization and comparison
- **Reduced power consumption**: No unnecessary BLE advertising

## üì° MQTT Topic Structure (Updated)

### Standard Topics
- `consultease/faculty/{faculty_id}/status` - Legacy status messages
- `consultease/faculty/{faculty_id}/mac_status` - **NEW** Detailed MAC status with JSON payload
- `consultease/faculty/{faculty_id}/requests` - Consultation requests
- `consultease/faculty/{faculty_id}/messages` - Plain text messages

### Legacy Topics (Backward Compatibility)
- `professor/status` - Legacy status messages
- `professor/messages` - Legacy message format

### Message Formats
```json
// MAC Status Topic Payload
{
  "status": "faculty_present|faculty_absent",
  "mac": "12:34:56:78:9A:BC",
  "timestamp": 1234567890
}
```

## üéØ Benefits Achieved
