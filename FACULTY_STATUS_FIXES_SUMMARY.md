# Faculty Status Update Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Database Session Management Error (DetachedInstanceError)
**Problem**: Faculty controller was experiencing `DetachedInstanceError` when trying to update faculty status because faculty objects were being accessed outside of their database session context.

**Root Cause**: The error occurred in the `update_faculty_status` method when trying to access faculty object attributes after the database session was closed.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `update_faculty_status` method in `central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py`
- Added proper session management with explicit commit and refresh operations
- Created safe faculty data dictionary within the session context
- Added proper callback notification after successful updates
- Improved error handling and logging

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Before: Faculty object accessed outside session context
return faculty

# After: Proper session management with explicit operations
with db_manager.get_session_context() as db:
    # ... update operations ...
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(faculty)
    updated_faculty = faculty

# Notify callbacks outside session
if updated_faculty:
    self._notify_callbacks(updated_faculty)
```

### 2. Dashboard Real-time Updates Issue
**Problem**: Faculty availability only updated after logout/login because the dashboard wasn't properly listening to MQTT status updates.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard window had no MQTT listeners to receive real-time faculty status changes from ESP32 desk units.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added MQTT listener setup in dashboard window initialization
- Implemented `_setup_mqtt_listeners()` method to subscribe to faculty status topics
- Added `_handle_faculty_status_update()` and `_handle_system_notification()` methods
- Implemented proper cleanup of MQTT listeners on window close

**Key Changes**:
```python
def _setup_mqtt_listeners(self):
    """Set up MQTT listeners for real-time faculty status updates."""
    subscribe_to_topic("consultease/faculty/+/status", self._handle_faculty_status_update)
    subscribe_to_topic(MQTTTopics.SYSTEM_NOTIFICATIONS, self._handle_system_notification)

def _handle_faculty_status_update(self, topic, data):
    """Handle faculty status updates from MQTT."""
    QTimer.singleShot(500, self.refresh_faculty_status)  # Batch updates
```

### 3. Consultation Form Data Type Error
**Problem**: The error showed that `faculty_data` was being passed as an integer instead of a dictionary to the `show_consultation_form_safe` method, causing `TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable`.

**Root Cause**: Lambda function closure issue in `populate_faculty_grid` method where faculty objects were being captured instead of faculty data dictionaries.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed lambda function closures in `populate_faculty_grid` method
- Modified consultation callbacks to use `faculty_data` dictionaries instead of faculty objects
- Enhanced `show_consultation_form_safe` method with robust data type validation
- Added fallback logic to handle both integer IDs and dictionary data

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Before: Using faculty object (could become detached)
consultation_callback=lambda f=faculty: self.show_consultation_form(f)

# After: Using faculty data dictionary (safe)
consultation_callback=lambda f_data=faculty_data: self.show_consultation_form_safe(f_data)

# Enhanced validation in show_consultation_form_safe
if isinstance(faculty_data, int):
    # Handle case where faculty ID is passed instead of data
    faculty = faculty_controller.get_faculty_by_id(faculty_data)
    # Convert to dictionary format
```

## Technical Improvements

### Database Session Management
- Implemented proper session context management with explicit commits
- Added session refresh operations to ensure object consistency
- Improved error handling with detailed logging and tracebacks

### Real-time Updates
- Added MQTT subscription for faculty status changes
- Implemented batched UI updates to prevent excessive refreshes
- Added proper cleanup of MQTT listeners on window close

### Error Handling
- Enhanced data type validation in consultation form methods
- Added fallback mechanisms for different data formats
- Improved error messages and logging throughout the system

### Performance Optimizations
- Used batched UI updates with QTimer.singleShot for MQTT events
- Maintained existing caching mechanisms while fixing session issues
- Preserved pooled faculty card management for UI performance

## Files Modified

1. **central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py**
   - Fixed `update_faculty_status` method with proper session management
   - Added explicit commit and refresh operations
   - Improved callback notification system

2. **central_system/views/dashboard_window.py**
   - Added MQTT listener setup and handlers
   - Fixed lambda function closures in faculty grid population
   - Enhanced consultation form data validation
   - Added proper cleanup methods

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **Database Errors**: The `DetachedInstanceError` should no longer occur when updating faculty status
2. **Real-time Updates**: Faculty availability should update immediately when ESP32 desk units report status changes
3. **Consultation Form**: Clicking on faculty cards should properly open the consultation form without type errors
4. **System Stability**: Overall system should be more robust with better error handling and logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test faculty status updates from ESP32 desk units
2. Verify dashboard updates in real-time without requiring logout/login
3. Test consultation form opening from faculty cards
4. Monitor logs for any remaining database session issues
5. Test system under concurrent faculty status updates
