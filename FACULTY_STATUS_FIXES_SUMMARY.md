# Faculty Status Update Fixes - Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Database Session Management Error (DetachedInstanceError)
**Problem**: Faculty controller was experiencing `DetachedInstanceError` when trying to update faculty status because faculty objects were being accessed outside of their database session context.

**Root Cause**: The error occurred in the `update_faculty_status` method when trying to access faculty object attributes after the database session was closed.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `update_faculty_status` method in `central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py`
- Added proper session management with explicit commit and refresh operations
- Created safe faculty data dictionary within the session context
- Added proper callback notification after successful updates
- Improved error handling and logging

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Before: Faculty object accessed outside session context
return faculty

# After: Proper session management with explicit operations
with db_manager.get_session_context() as db:
    # ... update operations ...
    db.commit()
    db.refresh(faculty)
    updated_faculty = faculty

# Notify callbacks outside session
if updated_faculty:
    self._notify_callbacks(updated_faculty)
```

### 2. Dashboard Real-time Updates Issue
**Problem**: Faculty availability only updated after logout/login because the dashboard wasn't properly listening to MQTT status updates.

**Root Cause**: Dashboard window had no MQTT listeners to receive real-time faculty status changes from ESP32 desk units.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added MQTT listener setup in dashboard window initialization
- Implemented `_setup_mqtt_listeners()` method to subscribe to faculty status topics
- Added `_handle_faculty_status_update()` and `_handle_system_notification()` methods
- Implemented proper cleanup of MQTT listeners on window close

**Key Changes**:
```python
def _setup_mqtt_listeners(self):
    """Set up MQTT listeners for real-time faculty status updates."""
    subscribe_to_topic("consultease/faculty/+/status", self._handle_faculty_status_update)
    subscribe_to_topic(MQTTTopics.SYSTEM_NOTIFICATIONS, self._handle_system_notification)

def _handle_faculty_status_update(self, topic, data):
    """Handle faculty status updates from MQTT."""
    QTimer.singleShot(500, self.refresh_faculty_status)  # Batch updates
```

### 3. Consultation Form Data Type Error
**Problem**: The error showed that `faculty_data` was being passed as an integer instead of a dictionary to the `show_consultation_form_safe` method, causing `TypeError: 'int' object is not subscriptable`.

**Root Cause**: Lambda function closure issue in `populate_faculty_grid` method where faculty objects were being captured instead of faculty data dictionaries.

**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed lambda function closures in `populate_faculty_grid` method
- Modified consultation callbacks to use `faculty_data` dictionaries instead of faculty objects
- Enhanced `show_consultation_form_safe` method with robust data type validation
- Added fallback logic to handle both integer IDs and dictionary data

**Key Changes**:
```python
# Before: Using faculty object (could become detached)
consultation_callback=lambda f=faculty: self.show_consultation_form(f)

# After: Using faculty data dictionary (safe)
consultation_callback=lambda f_data=faculty_data: self.show_consultation_form_safe(f_data)

# Enhanced validation in show_consultation_form_safe
if isinstance(faculty_data, int):
    # Handle case where faculty ID is passed instead of data
    faculty = faculty_controller.get_faculty_by_id(faculty_data)
    # Convert to dictionary format
```

## Technical Improvements

### Database Session Management
- Implemented proper session context management with explicit commits
- Added session refresh operations to ensure object consistency
- Improved error handling with detailed logging and tracebacks

### Real-time Updates
- Added MQTT subscription for faculty status changes
- Implemented batched UI updates to prevent excessive refreshes
- Added proper cleanup of MQTT listeners on window close

### Error Handling
- Enhanced data type validation in consultation form methods
- Added fallback mechanisms for different data formats
- Improved error messages and logging throughout the system

### Performance Optimizations
- Used batched UI updates with QTimer.singleShot for MQTT events
- Maintained existing caching mechanisms while fixing session issues
- Preserved pooled faculty card management for UI performance

## Files Modified

1. **central_system/controllers/faculty_controller.py**
   - Fixed `update_faculty_status` method with proper session management
   - Added explicit commit and refresh operations
   - Improved callback notification system

2. **central_system/views/dashboard_window.py**
   - Added MQTT listener setup and handlers
   - Fixed lambda function closures in faculty grid population
   - Enhanced consultation form data validation
   - Added proper cleanup methods

## Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

### Issue 1: Duplicate Callback Notifications
**Problem**: The `_notify_callbacks` method was being called twice - once in `update_faculty_status` and once in `handle_faculty_status_update`, causing potential DetachedInstanceError.

**Fix Applied**: Removed duplicate callback notification from `update_faculty_status` and implemented safe callback notification in `handle_faculty_status_update` using faculty data dictionaries instead of faculty objects.

### Issue 2: Dashboard Logger Scope Error
**Problem**: Logger variable was not properly scoped in dashboard window exception handlers.

**Fix Applied**: Removed redundant logger import and used the module-level logger consistently.

### Issue 3: Faculty Object Session Management
**Problem**: Faculty objects were being passed to callbacks outside their database session context, causing DetachedInstanceError.

**Fix Applied**: Created safe faculty data dictionaries for callback notifications to avoid session-related issues.

## Expected Results

After these fixes:

1. **Database Errors**: The `DetachedInstanceError` should no longer occur when updating faculty status
2. **Real-time Updates**: Faculty availability should update immediately when ESP32 desk units report status changes
3. **Consultation Form**: Clicking on faculty cards should properly open the consultation form without type errors
4. **System Stability**: Overall system should be more robust with better error handling and logging
5. **MQTT Processing**: MQTT message processing should resume normal operation with proper database logging

## CRITICAL MQTT CONNECTIVITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED

### Root Cause: MQTT Broker Connection Failure
**Analysis**: The logs show no MQTT message processing activity, indicating the MQTT service is not successfully connecting to the broker.

**Evidence**:
- No MQTT connection logs in the system output
- No faculty status update messages being processed
- ESP32 desk units configured for `192.168.1.100` or `172.20.10.8`
- Central system configured for `localhost` by default

### MQTT Configuration Mismatch
**Problem**: The central system is trying to connect to `localhost:1883` but the ESP32 desk units are configured to publish to different IP addresses.

**ESP32 Configuration** (from `faculty_desk_unit/config.h`):
```c
#define MQTT_SERVER "192.168.1.100"  // or "172.20.10.8"
#define MQTT_PORT 1883
```

**Central System Configuration** (default):
```python
'mqtt': {
    'broker_host': 'localhost',  # ‚ùå MISMATCH!
    'broker_port': 1883,
}
```

## IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED

### Fix 1: Install and Configure MQTT Broker
```bash
# Install Mosquitto MQTT broker
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients

# Start and enable the service
sudo systemctl start mosquitto
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto

# Test the broker
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test/topic -m "test message"
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test/topic
```

### Fix 2: Configure Central System MQTT Settings
Create or update `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
# MQTT Configuration
MQTT_BROKER_HOST=192.168.1.100  # Use your actual IP
MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883
MQTT_USERNAME=  # Leave empty if no auth
MQTT_PASSWORD=  # Leave empty if no auth
```

### Fix 3: Verify Network Configuration
```bash
# Check your actual IP address
ip addr show

# Test MQTT broker connectivity
telnet 192.168.1.100 1883
# or
nc -zv 192.168.1.100 1883
```

## Debugging Steps to Verify Fixes

1. **Run MQTT Connection Diagnostic**:
   ```bash
   python mqtt_connection_diagnostic.py
   ```

2. **Check MQTT Service Status**:
   - Verify MQTT broker is running: `sudo systemctl status mosquitto`
   - Check MQTT service connection logs
   - Monitor MQTT message handlers registration

3. **Test Faculty Status Updates**:
   - Send test MQTT messages to `consultease/faculty/1/status`
   - Monitor faculty controller logs for message processing
   - Verify database updates are occurring

4. **Monitor Dashboard Updates**:
   - Check if dashboard MQTT listeners are properly registered
   - Verify real-time faculty status updates without logout/login
   - Test consultation form opening functionality

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test faculty status updates from ESP32 desk units
2. Verify dashboard updates in real-time without requiring logout/login
3. Test consultation form opening from faculty cards
4. Monitor logs for any remaining database session issues
5. Test system under concurrent faculty status updates
6. Check MQTT service health and connection status
7. Verify faculty controller MQTT subscriptions are active
